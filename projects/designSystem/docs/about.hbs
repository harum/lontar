Hello. My name is Putu Harum Bawa. I am from Bali, but currently working in
Jakarta, Indonesia. I currently work at <a href="https://www.bukalapak.com/">Bukalapak</a> as Front End Developer since August 2015.</p>

<p>I believe that the best way to learn is to teach about what we have learned. Whether we teach other or teach our self by making a note, a blog or other medium. In this blog I try to explain and rewrite what I have learned. I really apreciated feedback and discussion from you.</p>

<p>I try to write my posts on English to practice my written English. I also want to write it on Bahasa after I have posted several blog post.</p>

<p>You can find me on Github and several social media. Here they are:</p>
